# Object-Oriented Programming Patterns

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns. These patterns are fundamental to writing organized and manageable code, and understanding them can greatly enhance your programming skills.

## Strategy Pattern

The first pattern we'll explore is the Strategy Pattern. This pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

### Structure

The Strategy Pattern involves three main components:

1. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object.
2. **Strategy**: Common interface for all supported algorithms. Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy.
3. **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface.

### Usage

The Strategy Pattern is used when:

- There are multiple ways to achieve something, and the best method can only be determined at runtime.
- You want to hide the complex or algorithm-specific data structures used by the algorithm from the client.

### Common Cases

1. **Routing**: You can use the Strategy pattern to handle different routing strategies. For instance, you might have different strategies for API routes, static file serving, and dynamic routes.
2. **Authentication**: Different strategies can be used for different authentication methods, such as OAuth, JWT, or basic username/password authentication. Libraries like Passport.js use this pattern extensively.
3. **DataValidation**: You can have different validation strategies for different types of data. For example, you might have one strategy for validating user input, another for validating file uploads, etc.
4. **DatabaseOperation**:If your application needs to support different databases (like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.), you can use the Strategy pattern to switch between different database operation strategies.
5. **Payment Processing**: If your web application needs to handle different payment gateways (like Stripe, PayPal, etc.), the Strategy pattern can be used to switch between different payment processing strategies.

### Conclusion

Remember, the Strategy pattern is useful when you have several related classes that only differ in their behavior. Strategies provide a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors.
